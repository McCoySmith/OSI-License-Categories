# OSI-License-Categories
Part of a project to put more rigor to understanding the OSI license list and the relationships between the approved licenses

Initially launched at the Free Software Foundation Europe's (FSFE) Legal and Licensing Workshop (LLW) in Gothenberg, Sweden in 2024.

Aim here is to analyze the OSI approved license list (found here: https://opensource.org/license) to determine where licenses have common text, and also where, despite common text, they deviate from one another.

THe hope here is that it might help people navigate the full license list, as well as understand that many of the licenses are variants (sometimes relatively insubstantial variants) from one another.
